**BayesCovid: Uncovering Hidden and Complex Relations of Pandemic Dynamics using an AI-driven System**

This project provides a comprehensive application designed to uncover the complex relationships between COVID-19 symptoms and assist clinical staff in calculating the severity of COVID-19 based on detected symptoms. It leverages several key Python packages, including pgmpy for probabilistic graphical models, pandas for data manipulation, networkx for network analysis, and matplotlib for data visualization. Additionally, tkinter is used for the graphical user interface, and PyMuPDF (fitz) is utilised for handling PDF files. The application ensures efficient and accurate relationships between the symptoms and severity assessment, enhancing the decision-making process in clinical settings. Detailed installation instructions and usage guidelines are provided to facilitate easy setup and operation.
